   For develope component:
	
	you can developing the component with this source ,
	it's full enviroment for developing component.


        Here's the zkoss component guide.
	http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Component_Development_Essentials

        And the source code say that some detail you must know first.


	For testing , you can run WebContent/index.zul to check 
	   whether the component is working correctly.

	(just like a component )


   For deploy component:

	to use the component , you need to pack it to jar file first.


	Just pack all the resource(files,classes...) in src folder as a jar,
	and then put the component jar in your zk project.


     Steps:

	1.the sample jar i pack at version  5c63e149ddac9e917f7d

	  put the jar in WebContent/WEB-INF/lib.

	3.Write a zul like this file.
