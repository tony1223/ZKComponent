   What's this?


     Here is a sample project that explain how to create a zk component.

     I create a customize component , named 'mylabel' ,
     and it provide a label let you put your value inside .
 

   
     It was customize to a ugly color style with css ,
     you can find that in the code.


     And I take one customize event , 
     to show you how to communicate with server.

     1. "BINDING EVENT" and "FIRE EVENT" when clicked in client 

     2. "SERVICE EVENT" / "EVENT LISTENER" in server ,

     3. do some response in server.
        (but not only response , but also you can call client side 
         widget method during "AUInvoke", too.)

  

   ------------------------------


   For develope component:
	
	you can developing the component with this source ,
	it's full enviroment for developing component with zk 5.0.3.


        Here's the zkoss component development guide.
	http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Component_Development_Essentials

        And the source code say that some detail you must know first.


	For testing , you can run WebContent/index.zul to check 
	   whether the component is working correctly.

	(just like a component )


   For deploy component:

	to use the component , you need to pack it to jar file first.


	Just pack all the resource(files,classes...) in src folder as a jar,
	and then put the component jar in your zk project.


     Steps:

	1.the sample jar i pack at version  5c63e149ddac9e917f7d
  	  http://github.com/downloads/tony1223/ZKComponent/zkComponent.jar

	
	2.Then I create a ZKTest zk project, 
	  put the jar in WebContent/WEB-INF/lib.

	3.Write a zul like this file.

	http://github.com/downloads/tony1223/ZKComponent/testComponent.zul


	And there should be everything works.
